<h2 id="toc_0.1">About the models</h2>
<p>
Owners are principals: identifiers representing users and other authority
entities such as groups or roles. 
</p>

<p>
At any moment, a process has the authority to act on behalf of some(possibily
empty) set of principals. 
</p>

<p>
A label <em>L</em> contains a set of owners, <em>owners(L)</em>; these are the principals
whose data was observed in order to obtain that value.
</p>
    
<p>
For each owners <em>O</em>, the label contains a set of readers, <em>readers(L,O)</em>;
these are the principals that <em>O</em> allows to observe the value;
</p>

<p>
Observations happen when values are written to <em>output channels</em>. Each output
channels <em>C</em> has an associated set of readers; these are the principals who will
be able to observe information written to that channel. A value can be written
to a channel only if each reader of the channel has the authority to act for
some reader in the <em>effective readers set</em> of the value's label.
</p>


<p>
Declassification can be performed only by a process with the authority to act
for the owner whose policy is being changed.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Adding readers.</strong> We should be able to add a reader <em>r</em> for some owner <em>o</em> if <em>O</em>
  already allows some reader <em>r'</em> that <em>r</em> acts for

</ul>
  
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Replacing owners.</strong> We should be able to replace an owner <em>o'</em> with some
  principal <em>o</em> that can act for <em>o'</em>
