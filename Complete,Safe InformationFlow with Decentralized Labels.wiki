== About the Model ==
Owners are principals: identifiers representing users and other authority
entities such as groups or roles.

Owners(L) are the principals whose data was observed in order to obtain that
value. For each owner _O_, the label contains a set of readers,
_readers(L,O)_; these are the principals that _O_ allows to observe the value.

Observations happen when values are written to _output channels_. Each output
channel _C_ has an associated set of readers; these are the principals who will
be able to observe information written to that channel. A value can be
written to a channel only if each reader of the channel has the authority to act
for some reader in the _effective readers set _ of the value's label.

Values may also be relabeled by _declassification_, which reduces
restrictiveness by removing an owner or adding a reader for an owner.
Declassification can be performed only by a process with the authority to act
for the owner whose policy is being changes;
