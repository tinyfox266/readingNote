<h2 id="toc_0.1">Introduction</h2>
<p>
<strong>Information flow.</strong> A system is noninterfering if the low security outputs of
 the system are independent of the high security inputs, and thus, an observer
 with low security clearance cannot deduce any information about high security
 data. When information originating from different principals is combined, the
 information flow restrictions of all principals must be enforced.
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Access control.</strong> the owner of a file can specify an access control list--a
  list of principals who may read the resource. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Software licensing.</strong> Software producers distribute software components under
 licenses that include restrictions on when the software may be composed with
 other components to form new software.
